# Human-Detection-in-Images

•  Preprocessed the images &  developed a deep learning model which can detect humans in images.

•  Used RandomFlip, BatchNormalisation, &  MaxPool2D to pre-process, normalise data &  reduce overfitting.

•  Used multiple layers in CNN to filter input volumes to higher level of abstraction in neural networks.
